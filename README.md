# E6863 Project - Fridge Model Checking

This is the final project for Columbia University CSEE E6863 Formal Verification HW/SW System.
It aims at performing bounded model checking on Fridge, a multi-threaded key-value store that supports nonblocking and blocking GET operation, to help locating bugs that are hard to find via normal testing method.

This project utilizes [CBMC](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/cbmc/) to perform model checking.
